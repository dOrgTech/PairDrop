# Pair2Pair
Pair2Pair is an experiment in retroactive public goods funding that directly empowers Ethereum users to allocate ecosystem funds.

Retroactive public goods funding is the concept of rewarding efforts that have already yielded a public benefit. This could address the problems associated with public goods funding, such as uncertainty of future outcomes and reporting/monitoring costs.

Putting this power into the hands of a diverse range of ecosystem participants can make it easier to target areas that are overlooked by centralized allocation bodies.
