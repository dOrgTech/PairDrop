# Voting Process in PairDrop

## Introduction

Voting is the core activity of the PairDrop platform, allowing community members to allocate funding to projects they believe are most deserving. This guide outlines the steps for participants to cast their votes and how the voting process works.

## Prerequisites

Before voting, ensure you are eligible to vote by being on the voters list, and have your wallet connected to the PairDrop client.

## Step 1: Logging In and Wallet Connection

1. Visit the PairDrop client and click on the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. Select your wallet provider and follow the prompts to connect your wallet.

## Step 2: Accessing Voting Page

Upon logining in, if you have voting power, you'll be introduced to the platform through a 5-step interactive walkthrough, which prepares you for the voting process. However, if you don't have a score, you'll see a message indicating that you do not qualify for voting this round, skipping the walkthrough. Once you complete the walkthrough, you'll be redirected to the voting page, where you'll start evaluating the first pair of projects. The PairDrop platform utilizes a pairwise comparison method, offering you an intuitive way to decide which projects to support.

## Step 3: Reviewing Project Pairs

As you evaluate each pair of projects, immerse yourself in the details provided for an informed decision-making process. This encompasses project descriptions, objectives, achievements, and any pertinent information. Leverage the comprehensive evaluation guide from the PairDrop walkthrough, which outlines critical criteria for your consideration:

- **Impact Assessment:** Gauge the project's influence based on its funding history and the magnitude of the problem it addresses. Consider how significant the project's contribution has been and the potential for future impact.
- **Resource Allocation:** Reflect on whether the project could significantly advance its mission with full resources, thus moving the needle on its focus issue.
- **Underserved Areas:** Evaluate the project's reach in terms of geographical location, topic, and visibility within the ecosystem. This helps identify projects that are making a difference in areas that are often overlooked.
- **Personal Judgement:** Use your best judgment for projects you're less familiar with, focusing on their potential impact on diverse innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.

This guided approach, enriched with specific criteria, is designed to facilitate a thoughtful review process, ensuring that your votes support projects poised to make a significant impact.

## Step 4: Casting Your Vote

After evaluating both projects in a pair, select the project you believe should receive funding by clicking the "Check" icon associated with that project then by cliking "Next" or "Finish" depending on the pair number. Your vote will be automatically recorded and will contribute to the project's overall score.

## Step 5: Completing All Pair Comparisons

Proceed with evaluating each project pair presented. The total number of pairs is determined by the current round's configuration, ensuring a comprehensive review process tailored to the voting session.

## Step 6: Finalizing Your Votes

Upon completing your votes for all project pairs, you'll automatically navigate to the "My Votes" page. Here, you'll have the opportunity to review all the pairs you've voted on. Should you wish to adjust any of your selections, you have the flexibility to modify your votes for any pair by clicking on the voted pair card. This final step ensures your voting choices accurately reflect your decisions before they are finalized in the PairDrop platform.

## Voting Algorithm

The PairDrop platform uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the overall scores of projects based on the pairwise votes. This ensures a fair and transparent allocation of funds, reflecting the collective preference of the community.

## Conclusion

The voting process in PairDrop is designed to be straightforward yet powerful, allowing community members to effectively participate in the allocation of funds to deserving projects. By following these steps, you contribute to a democratic and transparent funding process.
